## Overview 

This sample, non-production-ready template describes a CloudFormation template to deploy the infraestructure needed to host the NDI DIscovery Servers on an existing VPC.

This pattern is designed for broadcast engineers or individuals with minimal AWS experience, and provides a streamlined method for swift provisioning and dismantling of NDI environments for live production setups, leveraging the elasticity and flexibility of AWS infrastructure. utilizing the elasticity and flexibility of AWS infrastructure.

AWS provides services that enable the creation, deployment and maintenance of infrastructure in a programmatic, descriptive, and declarative way and these services provide rigor, clarity, and reliability. AWS CloudFormation enables developers to create AWS resources in an orderly and predictable fashion. Resources are written in template files using JSON or YAML format. Then, CloudFormation reads the template and generates the stacks, that are deployed in a safe, repeatable manner.

NDI is a royalty-free protocol developed by NewTek (Vizrt) to enable video-compatible products to share video across a local area network (LAN). The NDI discovery service is designed to allow you to replace the automatic discovery NDI uses with a server that operates as a centralized registry of NDI sources.

This pattern provides a method to deploy the NDI Discovery Servers through a CloudFormation template presenting the required information for the deployment as input parameters on the template.

We have chosen CloudFormation as the method of deployment over alternative approaches (like CDK) because it is the simplest level of abstraction of Infrastructure as a Code. It’s console driven and it handles the end to end life cycle: creating, updating and deleting the stack which you wouldn’t get from a Python or a CLI script. And last it leaves a visual point of reference in the console itself.

When you launch an instance in Amazon EC2, you have the option of passing "User Data" to the instance that can be used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. We are using the CloudFormation helper script cfn-init to install the NDI packages and start the "ndi-discovery" service. After this process we communicate back to CloudFormation the success of the installation using the cfn-signal helper script to finilise the deployment of the Stack.  

The Instance Profile role associated to the EC2 instances have an AWS managed policy attached: "AmazonSSMManagedEC2InstanceDefaultPolicy". This allows AWS Systems Manager to manage your Amazon EC2 instances automatically as managed instances. The benefits of managing your instances with Systems Manager include the following:

* Connect to your EC2 instances securely using Session Manager.
* Perform automated patch scans using Patch Manager.
* View detailed information about your instances using Systems Manager Inventory.
* Track and manage instances using Fleet Manager.
* Keep SSM Agent up to date automatically.

The target audience includes **Broadcast** engineers or individuals with minimal AWS experience, as the template reduces the need for coding or scripting expertise. This template doesn't require any packaging process (upload local artifcats to an S3 bucket) and the CloudFormation template can easily be re-used and customized for various live production deployments.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](assets/architecture-merged.png "Architecture Diagram")

### CloudFormation Deployment Steps:

1. The AWS **CloudFormation** Template defines the AWS resources and their configurations. In this first step the Template is used to deploy a **CloudFormation** Stack. 
2. **CloudFormation** provisions or updates the resources specified in the template..
3. **CloudFormation** creates an **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** Instance Profile. An Instance Profile is a container that passes an **IAM** role to an **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Instances (EC2)** instance. It defines the permissions that the **EC2** instance will have when interacting with other AWS services. The Instance Profile includes an **IAM** role and an **IAM** policy that specify the allowed actions and resources.
4. **CloudFormation** creates a security group, which acts as a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to **EC2** instances. 
5. **CloudFormation** creates two **EC2** instances, one in the private subnet 1 within Availability Zone 1, and another in the private subnet 2 within Availability Zone 2. These **EC2** instances use the Instance Profile from Step 3 and the security group from Step 4. They host the **NDI Discovery Server** application installed during the launch process.  
6. **CloudFormation** creates a private **Amazon Route 53** Hosted Zone with the A records for the two **EC2** Instances for managing DNS and routing traffic.

## Cost

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Guidance. As of Mars 2024, the cost for running this Guidance with the default settings in the US East (N. Virginia) is approximately $31.01 per month (on-demand) for each NDI Discovery Server (based on the t3.medium EC2 instances type) 

## Prerequisites

This AWS CloudFormation template will create an IAM Policy and an IAM Role that will be associated with the Instance Profile of the EC2 instances deployed. It also creates a Security Group associated to the instances. Last it also creates a Route 53 hosted zone and one A records per Instance. For that reason the credentials used when creating the CloudFormation stack will need to have sufficient privileges to create those resources.

The EC2 instances will download the sofwtare from a public repository fron NDI (downloads.ndi.tv), that means that the EC2 instances needs to be able to connect to the Internet to access the files, either asigning a public IP and using an Internet Gateway or a NAT Gateway if the instances are deployed in private subnets. 

Once deployed and as the EC2 instances are not launched with a Key Pair, Systems Manager is used to connect to them in case it's needed. This will require that the EC2 instances will be placed on a public subnet (using a public IP and the Internet Gateway) or in case the instances are deployed on private subnets then a NAT gateway or VPC endpoints are required to connect to the instances. 

### Operating System

The EC2 instances deployed will use the latest **<Amazon Linux 2023 >** AMI available in the region selected for deployment.

### Third-party tools

The EC2 instances will download and install the NDI SDK for Linux hosted in the ndi.video domain.

The Discovery Server application is part of the NDI SDK and you agree to accept the following NDI license agreement  by using this template
The text of the license that you are agreeing to  can be found here: https://downloads.ndi.tv/SDK/NDI_SDK/NDI%20License%20Agreement.pdf

The SDK can be downloaded after successfully registering using the following url: https://ndi.video/for-developers/ndi-sdk/download/

### AWS account requirements

This deployment requires you have the policies needed to deploy the resources deployed by CloudFormation.
This deployemnt requires an exisiting VPC with at less one Subnet to deploy the EC2 instance to host the Discovery Server (two Subnets if a redundant cofiguration is used)

## Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repo using command ```git clone aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-programatic-deployment-of-NDI-Discovery-Servers```
2. cd to the repo folder ```cd <guidance-for-programatic-deployment-of-NDI-Discovery-Servers>```
3. Navigate to the deployment folder and download the CloudFormation template: "ec2-ndi-discovery-servers-deployment-template.yml
4. Navigate to the CloudFormation console or use CLI and deploy the template either by manually upload it to an Amazon S3 bucket or if the template was uploaded before select the 'Amazon S3 URL'. 
5. Fill up the parameters of the template
6. Acknoledge the CloudFormation needed capabilities:

![Steps](assets/capabilities.png "Steps")

7. Wait until CloudFormation finishes deploying the different resources. Once deployed you can navigate to the outputs section and note down the private DNS names of the NDI Discovery Servers

Please be aware that "termination protection" is enabled on the EC2 instances, if you want to delete the Stack you will need to disable the termination protection on the EC2 instances first.

## Deployment Validation 


* On the CloudFormation console the Stack status should be "_**CREATE_COMPLETE**_" 
* If deployment is successful, you should be able to see one Instance per Subnet selected in the Resources tab, Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance"
* You can click on each of the Instances and connect to it using SSM, select the Instance and hit "Connect" (You may need to wait few minutes until the Instances is available). Once connected with Session Manager run the following command: ``` systemctl status ndi-discovery.service ```. You should see an answer from the service being active (running):

## Running the Guidance

This CloudFormation Template is built using parameters, please add the desired values for the different parameters:

Instance Configuration:

* InstanceName: the name that will be given to the EC2 instances, followed by the subnet where the Instance is deployed. 
* VolumeSize: the size of the EBS volume for the EC2 instances
* InstanceType: type of the EC2 instances to be used for the deployment, there are two pre define values, if a different type is needed select "_other_"
* InstanceTypeManual: in case a differnt type of EC2 instances is needed please set it up here.
* AmiID: this parameter is populated by default with the value of the latest Linux2 AMI on the region, if an especific AMI is required this parameter could be modified.

VPC Configuration:

* VpcId: the ID of the VPC where the Discovery Servers EC2 instances will be deployed. This information is used on the Security Group created by the template associated to the EC2 instances.
* VpcCidr: this is the CIDR of the VPC where the discovery servers EC2 instances will be deployed, this information is used on the Security Group to specify the IP's allowed to communicate with the discovery servers  
* SubnetIds: List of subnets to deploy to. An NDI discovery server will be deployed to each selected subnet. It is recommended to deploy two discovery servers placed in two different subnets for resilience.

Domain Settings:

* PrivateDnsName: name of the private domain to use for the NDI Discovery Servers endpoints. A new hosted zone will be created.

Business Tags:

* Owner: this is a TAG that will be associated with the EC2 instances representing the Owner, it's not mandatory but it's best practises to follow a TAG policy when deploying resources on AWS.


## Next Steps

Once the Discovery Servers are deployed and are up and running you can use them to register your NDI sources. If you are using the NDI Tools you can set up the discovery servers under the _Access Manager: Advance Configuration_.

Remember that NDI uses different protocols and ports for the NDI streams themselves, refer to the NDI Networking best practises to understand the allocation and create the Security Group for the NDI sender and receivers EC2 instances.     

## Cleanup

You can clean up all the resources deployed by simply deleteing the CloudFormation Stack. But as the option "termination protection" is enabled you will need to disable it before deleting the Stack. You can simply access each of the EC2 instances from the console and disable this option: "change termination protection"
